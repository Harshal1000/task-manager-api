# Task Manager REST API üöÄ

Welcome to the Task Manager REST API repository! This project was developed during my internship and is a backend REST API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It includes several modern features such as JWT authentication, request validation, rate limiting, real-time notifications via Socket.IO, email notifications using SendGrid, background job scheduling, file uploads using Cloudinary, and interactive API documentation via Swagger UI.

## Overview

The Task Manager REST API allows you to manage tasks with various levels of access control:

**User Role**: Standard tasks operations.

**Manager/Admin Role**: Access to additional administration endpoints.

## Features

- **JWT Token Based Authentication üîê**
  Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

- **Request Validation With Joi**
  Ensures robust request data validation.

- **Express-Rate Limit ‚ö°**
  Protects against brute force attacks by limiting repeated requests.

- **Role-Based Authorization**
  Differentiates access between admin/manager and user.

- **Real-Time Notifications**
  Implemented with Socket.IO.

- **Email Notifications üìß**
  Integrated with SendGrid for sending email alerts.

- **Background Job Scheduling**
  Handles scheduled tasks such as the deletion of failed images.

- **Swagger UI Documentation üìÑ**
  Interactive API documentation for easy testing and integration.

- **File Uploading**
  Utilizes Cloudinary for seamless file uploads.

## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Joi, Express-Rate-Limit, Socket.IO, SendGrid, Cloudinary, Swagger UI

[ **Note:** While the focus is on backend development, if you expand the project with a client-side application, you might consider tools like React, Redux, and TailwindCSS. ]
